From an early age, I was fascinated with electronics.
Used to brake/fix vinyl players, boomboxes, and stereos.
Then got Hooked with early consoles like Atari 2600, Sega Megadrive, Gameboy, etc.
Then got my Personal Computer exactly when windows 95 got out. Back then 
my friends and I were gathering old, out-of-date machines running DOS or
if we were lucky Windows NT and we were fixing them just for fun. 
In the spare time, we had we were breaking games up instead of playing them.
So a relationship of love and addiction started and keeps blazing still.
Therefore I'm happy to inform you that with the help of my colleagues,
I'm fortunate to use my passion and help you with anything your project needs.
From hardware to software and from game development with C# and unity to
making web-based applications with Javascript/Typescript, Meteor, and MongoDB.
I'm experienced enough to make any Dream... Reality!
